<h2>history of  programming languages

 </h2>
Shortly thereafter, programs can be written in machine language, where the programmer writes each instruction in digital format that the devices can implement directly. For example, instructions for adding the value in two memory locations may consist of 3 numbers: an "operating code" that specifies the "adding" process, and two memory locations. The software has been read, in decimal or binary form, from perforated cards, paper tape, or magnetic tape, or has been swapped in keys on the front panel of the computer. Machine languages ​​were later called first-generation programming languages ​​(1GL).

The next step was to develop so-called second-generation programming languages ​​(2GL) or assembly languages, which were still closely related to the structure of the instruction set for the specific computer. This made the program easier for human readability and excused boring and error-prone address programmer.

The first high-level programming languages, or 3G languages, were written in the 1950s. An early-level programming language developed for the computer was Plankalkül, which was developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000. [26]

John Mowgli's short code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ​​to be developed for an electronic computer. Unlike the machine icon, short symbol phrases represent mathematical expressions understandably. However, the program had to be translated to the machine icon every time it was started, which made the process much slower than running the equivalent device icon.

At the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie Autocode developed in the early 1950s. As a programming language, use a translator to automatically convert the language to a device icon. The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first grouped high-level programming language. [28] [29]

The second auto code of Mark 1 was developed by R. A. Brooker in 1954 and it was called "Mark 1 Autocode". Brooker also developed a robot for Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s jointly with the University of Manchester. The EDSAC 2 version was released by DF Hartley from the University of Cambridge Mathematics Lab in 1961. Known as the EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a direct development of Mercury Autocode adapted to local conditions and it was observed to improve object code and source language diagnoses that were developed at the time. The Autocode Atlas, a contemporary but separate thread for development, was developed for the Manchester Atlas 1 University machine.

In 1954, John Backus invented FORTRAN at IBM. It was the first widely used high-level programming language to be used functionally, rather than just a design on paper. [30] [31] It remains a common language for high-performance computing [32] and is used for programs that measure and rate the world's fastest supercomputers. [33]

Grace Hopper has invented another early programming language in the United States, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for UNIVAC I in Remington Rand from 1955 to 1959. Hopper found that business data processing clients were uncomfortable with sports blogging, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote and wrote a prototype for an programming language in English. [34] The FLOW-MATIC translator became available to the public in early 1958 and was largely completed in 1959. [35] FLOW-MATIC had great influence on the design of COBOL, since only he and his direct descendant AIMACO were in actual use at the time.
