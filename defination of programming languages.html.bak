The programming language is a coding for writing programs, and it is an algorithm or algorithm. [3] Some authors limit the term “programming language” to those languages ​​that can express all possible algorithms. [3] [4] Attributes are often considered important for what constitutes a programming language: Job and goal Computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer that performs some type of computing [5] or an algorithm and may control external devices such as printers, drives, robots [6], etc. For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a printer or computer monitor. More generally, a programming language can describe a calculation on some devices, perhaps even abstract. It is generally accepted that the full specifications of a programming language include a description, possibly ideal, of a machine or processor for that language. [7] In most practical contexts, the programming language includes a computer; Thus, programming languages ​​are usually identified and studied in this way. [8] Programming languages ​​differ from natural languages ​​as only natural languages ​​are used for interpersonal interaction, while programming languages ​​also allow humans to deliver instructions to devices. Abstraction Programming languages ​​usually contain summaries to define and manipulate data structures or control implementation flow. The practical necessity that supports the programming language of adequate abstraction is expressed through the abstraction principle.
